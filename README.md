?? Who made this ???

Me! I did mostly! Well what actually see is created by the browser's ability to render all the code I've written so I guess whoever made your browser too. Also, whoever wants to contribute can feel free to put themselves here (which might even be you!!!) !!!!!

?? What is this ??

It's a collection of javascript files I made while I was bored over the past few years. I was looking to create a pixel editor / animation suite in the browser-- no real need just to see if it can be done. It can! Meh! 

  After finding repeated needs I tried to break it down into objects you can plug in and play with. Gross right? Letting hundreds and possibly a thousand people plug in and play with my modules?

?? H ow does it wo r k ? ?

  Mostly mathan'magic.

?? WHY DO YOU WANT ME TO USE THIS *GARBAGE*!?! ??

  I don't. I don't actually use this myself anymore. Hey maybe I will and update the README to reflect that one day... GIT!
  
  ?? WHEN DO I GET PAID??
